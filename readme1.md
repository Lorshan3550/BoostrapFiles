The error message you're seeing indicates that the branch you're trying to push (`main`) has diverged from the remote branch (`main`) and that the remote branch has changes that you don't have locally. To resolve this issue, you need to incorporate the remote changes into your local branch before pushing again. You can do this by following these steps:

1. First, make sure you have committed all your local changes. You can check your local branch status with:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   If you have uncommitted changes, either commit them or stash them using `git stash` so that your working directory is clean.

2. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

   This command will update your local repository with the changes from the remote repository but won't merge or modify your working branch.

3. Now that you have the latest changes from the remote repository, you can rebase your local branch onto the remote branch:

   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

   This command will replay your local commits on top of the latest changes from the remote branch. If there are any conflicts during the rebase, you'll need to resolve them.

4. Once the rebase is complete, you can push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   This should now work without any issues since your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch.

If you're not comfortable with rebasing and want to merge the changes from the remote branch into your local branch instead, you can use the following steps:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository as previously shown:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Merge the remote changes into your local branch:

   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   ```

   If there are conflicts, resolve them and then commit the merge.

3. Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

These steps should allow you to push your changes to the remote repository after incorporating the remote changes.
